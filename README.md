# Online-Bookstore
This is online bookstore written in html and JavaScript.
In this project, I first wrote html codes for the home page that shows how many sections we have in this bookstore. There are two sections in this bookstore. one for adults and one for kids. 
If we click on either of these sections, we can select buy the book and then from there we are directed to login page. 
After login we can pay for the book if we want with entering the bank card details.
In case we are not regestered we can first regester when we select buy the book and fill the regestration form. After that we can login and buy the book. 
These lines are explanation of html codes. I have 5 html pages for 5 different links that are used in this project. 
I also added one css page in order to style the pages. 
On javascript side, I had one page that has different parts to cover the tasks of the given project. 
First I have the part for user regestration.
After regestration log in comes in. 
After that, user buys a book and pays for the book. 
Then I add the part for showing which user buy which book. I defined 3 differnet users that buy differnt books. 
and finally I wrote a code to show which books I have in stock followed by the number of those books in stock.
